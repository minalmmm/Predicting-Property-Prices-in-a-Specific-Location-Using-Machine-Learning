# Predicting-Property-Prices-in-a-Specific-Location-Using-Machine-Learning
# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for accurately predicting property prices in a specific location. By leveraging various regression algorithms and analyzing key features, the project provides valuable insights and a reliable tool for stakeholders, including real estate investors, property developers, and homebuyers, to make informed decisions.

# Objectives
Develop an accurate machine learning model to predict property prices.
Gather and preprocess relevant data on property prices and associated features.
Explore and evaluate multiple regression algorithms.
Assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Identify significant features influencing property prices.
Provide stakeholders with insights and a reliable predictive tool.
# Data Collection
Data was gathered from various sources, including real estate websites, government databases, and APIs. The dataset includes features such as property size, number of rooms, location-specific attributes, property age, and other relevant factors.

# Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Scale numerical features for uniformity.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
# Model Development
The following regression algorithms were explored:

# Linear Regression
# KNN Regressor
# Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
# Random Forest Regressor
Each model was trained, and hyperparameters were tuned to optimize performance.

# Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (R^2) Score
# Key Findings
The Random Forest Regressor demonstrated the best performance with an R^2 score of 0.8671, explaining approximately 86.71% of the variance in property prices.
Significant features influencing property prices include property size, location, and number of rooms.
# Insights for Stakeholders
Real Estate Investors and Developers:
Use the Random Forest Regressor model to evaluate potential property investments based on key features.
# Homebuyers:
Utilize the model to estimate fair property prices and make informed purchasing decisions.
# Conclusion
The Random Forest Regressor is recommended for predicting property prices due to its high accuracy and reliability. The insights provided help stakeholders understand market trends and the factors driving property values.
